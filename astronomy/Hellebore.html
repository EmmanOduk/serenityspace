                <p>- The genus Helleborus includes more than 20 species, originating in Europe and asia 
                <br>

                <br>
                - Produces glossy, green leaves which remain on the plant all year long (never acc falls off)
                <br>
                - Hellebore produces individual flowers consisting of 5 sepals & cup shaped nectaries. Wild types of hellebore produce green, greenish purple and golden yellow colored flowers. But new varieties can be created through the hybridization of existing species (white, yellow, pink, red, grey, deep purple and nearly black)
                <br>

                <br>
                - They are pest resistant, and specifically the White hellebore are highly toxic
                <br>

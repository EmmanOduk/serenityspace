                    •Neptune is cold, dark and icy, and has 14 known moons. Triton is its largest moon. Triton has ice volcanoes and a sub-surface ocean 
                    <br>
                    •It is considered an ice giant with 30 A.U. (astronomical units) away (30 times the distance between sun and earth)
                    <br>
                    •It has a diameter of 3.88 Earths as well as being the 8th planet from the sun (most distant). Due to this being the case, it has the longer orbit period – 165 years, seasons lasting 40 earth years each
                    <br>
                    • Neptune’s core is made of water ice & silicate rock. The rest of the planet is a hot, pressurized ocean of water, methane and ammonia ice
                    <br>
                    • The atmosphere mainly consists of clouds predominantly made of hydrogen and helium clouds with traces of methane (traces of methane give it its blue color)
                    <br>
                    • Even though Neptune appears relatively peaceful and stable, the planet is subjected to extreme weather conditions. Having winds on Neptune reach speeds of 1200 mphs (5x faster than strongest winds recorded on earth), because the winds are so powerful they break the sound barrier 
                    <br>
                    • On an interesting perspective, Neptune has 6 rings containing ring arc’s (clusters of dust particles in a ring)
